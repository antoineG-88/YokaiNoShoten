Raïdo	Seiki, before you leave, I have something more to ask. 	Question	1
Raïdo	We drew up a plan to definitivly stop the Selvos. But I fear that our technician, Tekuno, have been captured by the enemy.	Sad	1
Raïdo	He was suppose to open the door to the tower's heart. And use one of the very explosive Selvos core to destroy it.  	Shocked	1
Raïdo	If you find and free him while searching your siblings, I will feel beholden.	Ok	1
Raïdo	I wish you luck young fox, and may the great zenchi tree be with you.	Ok	1
