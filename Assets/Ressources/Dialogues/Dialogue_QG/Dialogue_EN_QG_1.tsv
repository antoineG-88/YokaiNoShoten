Unknown Inugami	Dash, I can sense your presence... __But you are not alone.	Question	1
Dash	Master Raïdo, this is Seiki, a quick fox that infiltrated the tower by himself.	Happy	1
Raïdo	That is quite unusual.__ But you are welcome, young Seiki.__ What brings you here ?	Happy	1
Dash	He entered right after a group of prisonners has arrived. I guess that he has relatives among them.	Sad	1
Raïdo	Reckless... But I understand. We will help you find your friends. They must be detained in the laboratory, two floors above. 	Ok	1
Raïdo	But it won't be easy, the doors are well guarded by special keys, that requiered speed and precision to be activated.  	Neutral	1
Dash	Quick fox wasn't a bad surname aft'er all. 	Happy	1
Raïdo	I will wait for you at the entrance. You can explore our humble HQ in the meantime. 	Ok	1
